This demos how to use local storageclass PV.

k8s 1.30.0 requires storageclass config for 'local', though dynamic pv is not supported. the storageclass config makes lazy binding of PC and PVC possible.

Files on the work node are not deleted when the deployment, pv, and pvc are deleted.

0, create directory for 'local' on work nodes
  node$ mkdir /pv-data

1, create storageclass for 'local'
  $ local-storageclass.yml

2, create 'local' PV manually. (dynamic pv is not supported by 'local')
  $ busybox-pv.yml

3, create a busybox deployment with pvc to use local PV
  $ busybox-storage.yml

4, in pod, write data to local pv, and verify on node
